# Example coturn configuration for BigBlueButton

# These are the two network ports used by the TURN server which the client
# may connect to. We enable the standard unencrypted port 3478 for STUN,
# as well as port 443 for TURN over TLS, which can bypass firewalls.
listening-port=3478
tls-listening-port=443

# If the server has multiple IP addresses, you may wish to limit which
# addresses coturn is using. Do that by setting this option (it can be
# specified multiple times). The default is to listen on all addresses.
# You do not normally need to set this option.
#listening-ip=172.17.19.101

# If the server is behind NAT, you need to specify the external IP address.
# If there is only one external address, specify it like this:
#external-ip=

# If you have multiple external addresses, you have to specify which
# internal address each corresponds to, like this. The first address is the
# external ip, and the second address is the corresponding internal IP.
#external-ip=172.17.19.131/10.0.0.11
#external-ip=172.17.18.132/10.0.0.12

# Configure coturn to use the "TURN REST API" method for validating time-
# limited credentials. BigBlueButton will generate credentials in this
# format. Note that the static-auth-secret value specified here must match
# the configuration in BigBlueButton's turn-stun-servers.xml
# You can generate a new random value by running the command:
#   openssl rand -hex 16
use-auth-secret
static-auth-secret=@AUTH_SECRET@

# If the realm value is unspecified, it defaults to the TURN server hostname.
# You probably want to configure it to a domain name that you control to
# improve log output. There is no functional impact.
# realm=example.com
#realm=turn.dumalogiya.ru

# Configure TLS support.
# Adjust these paths to match the locations of your certificate files

# Option to set the log file name.
# By default, the turnserver tries to open a log file in
# /var/log, /var/tmp, /tmp and the current directory
# (Whichever file open operation succeeds first will be used).
# With this option you can set the definite log file name.
# The special names are "stdout" and "-" - they will force everything
# to the stdout. Also, the "syslog" name will force everything to
# the system log (syslog).
# In the runtime, the logfile can be reset with the SIGHUP signal
# to the turnserver process.
#
# /var/log is read only in the container, write to journald
